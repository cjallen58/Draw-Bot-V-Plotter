Originally this project was meant to build a V-plotter robot and all the software that controls it and that still is the ultimate end goal.
However after working on this for just over a month with the limited time I have and my inexperience, I now realize the python package is its own project. 
In the future I will probably split these but for now they will stay together.
The utils library included in this repo has a couple functions that I can see being useful in other areas esspecially the sorting algorithm I am current toiling over.
I will continue to update this README as the project grows and ultimatly reaches its sigularity where it is no longer feasable regardless of resources and man power, as all projects eventual do.
