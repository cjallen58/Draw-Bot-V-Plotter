Originally this project was meant to build a V-plotter robot and all the software that controls it and that still is the ultimate end goal.
However after working on this for just over a month with the limited time I have and my inexperience, I now realize the python package is its own project. 
In the future I will probably split these but for now they will stay together.
The utils library included in this repo has a couple functions that I can see being useful in other areas esspecially the sorting algorithm I am current toiling over.
I will continue to update this README as the project grows and ultimatly reaches its sigularity where it is no longer feasable regardless of resources and man power, as all projects eventual do.

I am a mechanical engineer and I wanted to get into robotics a bit so I decided to learn how to program. I started this project about a month after starting to learn C and python. If this repo is a mess and the code doesn't make a lot of sense it's because I have no idea what I'm doing but I am learning as I go. 

I want to build this entire project pretty much from scratch mostly as a learning tool and because I think the end result will be pretty neat. At the momment I plan on using python for image processing. I'll then use python to talk to an arduino over serial to send position data to stepper motors. I will also have to design the physical components but that should be the easy part (SHOULD BE).
