want to build a pen plotter bot

***CONSTRUCTION***
*Keep construction of bot as simple as possible becuase mechanics is not the goal of this project*
2 nema 17 stepper motors
simple belt and pulley for each motor
no gearbox needed
about half a meter from one motor to the other
make sure to weigh down belts propperly to hold tension in belt
idea is to be able to plot on C sized paper (17" x 22")
will not use entire paper but will scale down image in software to leave border

***SOFTWARE**
*I have a lot of ideas for this but implementing one the building is probably best*
take a raster image as input (most likely jpeg)
do some magic and turn it into a ton of motor instructions
instructions get sent over serial to an ardiuno that moves the 2 steppers
arduino returns a true value when motors reach new position
next position is sent
keep serial signal as simple as possible to reduce any lag time
a lot of instructions will need to be sent for a single image

    ***The Magic***
    - first idea
        grayscale image and then reduce even further to grayscale values
        as in for range 0 -> 75 make it 50
        do this for at most 6 regions
        covert each level of gray to a motion to be done by the motors
        layer these motions to add contrast over the entire image
        the lowest level of gray will be applied to the entire image
        next level is applied to only itself and levels above and so on
